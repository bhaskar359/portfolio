I am a passionate Software Engineer with two years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, and NestJS. I have a proven track record of creating UI components, enhancing API performance, and optimizing database queries.

I have implemented a microservices architecture, optimized MongoDB queries, and developed various services to enhance application performance. I also have experience in data migration and automated report generation.

I thrive on building scalable, user-friendly applications and improving team efficiency. I have earned certifications in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures and GitHub Foundations. Outside of work, I love music and movies, especially thrillers, and enjoy coding.
